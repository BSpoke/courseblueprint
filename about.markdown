## Heya! I'm Margaret

### Your customers deserve a top notch online learning exprience, and you deserve seamless program launches.

### That's why I'm here, so grab a drink and settle in to hear my entore life story (well... maybe just the last decade).

About 12 years ago, I dove DEEP into the world of web development. I loved the instant feedback of writing a line of code and seeing it render in the browser.

I gradually grew my business over the years by building these beautiful sites for clients, and I noticed a trend about 8 - 9 years ago. Clients were looking for solutions to put their knowledge into programs and make them widely available to their customer base.

My love of online learning was born. (Fun fact: the term Knowledge Commerce is now being used to finally articulate this type on online product)

These world-class experts in their field were now able to share their knowledge at scale.

At that time, all websites and online course systems needed a web developer to support them, and coding was required for all launches and configurations. This made creating online programs, courses and memberships quite expensive for the average website owner to monetize their content.

Things have come a long way in the last 8 years. Now there are dozens of no-code tools that allow you to create online programs and share your expertise with the world.

### Perfect right? ... riiiight?

Nope.

Therein lies another set of problems, and that’s where I come in.
The plethora of softwares and tools available to the average creator is overwhelming to say the least.

You’re in luck! I’ve created and launched over 100 online programs for clients, with over 80,000 students around the globe for my clients over the years.

I’ve helped my clients create 7-figure launches with ebooks, worksheets, checklists and a variety of other digital goods. We also combine physical products with their digital goods!

I’ve gained SO MUCH knowledge and experience and now I’m super stoked to bring that knowledge to you, and save you literally hundreds of hours of research, and trial and error.

### "But Marg..." (you can call me Marg, 'cause we're frinds now) "... I have no idea where to even start"

I got you.

There are sooo many solutions out there for your business, and I’m here to help you decide which ones you need, and most importantly, which you don’t.

Here's a quiz with a gift at the end to show you where your next best steps to start are (...) 

This will lead you to resources that will help you get started on your own.
